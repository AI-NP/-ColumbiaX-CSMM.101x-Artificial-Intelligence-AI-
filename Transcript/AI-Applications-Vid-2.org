Let us now talk about some of the state of the art applications in
artificial intelligence.
So you could think of many of them, AI is not only compelling,
it actually touches many aspects of our lives.
The first application one can think of is speech recognition,
in which we have Virtual assistants such as Siri from Apple, Echo from Amazon,
Google Now, or Cortana from Microsoft.
They kind of help get things done such as sending an email,
making a doctor appointment, finding a restaurant,
order pizza, or an Uber car, tell you the weather, and many more.
So this kind of technology leverages deep neural networks to handle natural language
understanding as speech recognition.
We are making good progress in this area of research, it's not top yet but
we can still use them for simple queries.
They are doing performing pretty well.
But this remains in the research area for now.
A second popular application of artificial intelligence is hand writing recognition.
For the history, in the mid 90s, the USPS, US Postal Services got very interested
in automatically sorting handwritten addresses and zip codes on envelope.
By the end of the 80s, Yann LeCun, who is an eminent researchers doing deep learning
and neural networks, has published a solution using neural networks to
recognize hand written digits on an envelope.
The same approach was adopted to
automatically recognize the digits on a check in ATM machines.
And hence the whole process of recognizing zip codes and
amounts of dollars on the check.
Checks were completely automated and
actually saved hundreds of millions of dollars to society.
A popular and
successful application of artificial intelligence is machine translation.
Machine translation actually existed since the beginning of artificial intelligence.
And the historical motivation is the US government actually wanting to translate
Russian text to English.
Unfortunately the first system using what we call mechanical translation or
one to one correspondence completely failed.
Here's an example drawn from the history of AI.
In which we have "out of sight,
out of mind" expression that got translated into French as "invisible,
imbecile" that actually completely changes the meaning of the expression.
Machine translation has gone through ups and downs in the literature and
many funding got cut after this kind of incidents that completely
mistranslated what you wanted, mistranslated the text.
Historically, machine translation has gone through lots of ups and
downs, cutting funding and so on and so forth.
Especially after this kind of mistranslations in
the Russian text specifically.
But today, machine translation became statistical, and
we talk about statistical machine translation
that leverages the vast amount of available translated corpuses.
So let's say online, we have access to a lot of texts from official governments and
also from let's say embassies, and
United Nations that publish texts both in English and other languages.
And this is a good quality text.
Translate that a text that could be, and was,
leveraged by machine translation systems.
While there is room for improvement,
machine translation has made significant progress and
we all use at some times online such as machine translation from Google translate.
That can handle today over 100 languages.
So if you plug in "out of sight, out of mind" one more time into the system,
you can see that the translation to French is much, much better and
is more faithful to the true meaning, true semantics of out of sight out of mind.
So huge progress has been made in machine translation today.
So another obvious application of artificial intelligence is robotics.
We know today of some robots such as Nao, and Asimo, you could here Asimo dancing,
but robotics has made a really important contributions and
important progress in the last years.
Robots can be important in may applications such as robotic surgery and
household keeping, and also navigation etc., etc.
So, there's a lot of progress on that front as well.
Another, and maybe unsuspected application of AI is recommender Systems.
So you know Netflix recommendation systems, Amazon recommendation system,
that leverages collaborative filtering, to look into the history
of your purchases and the history of other customers to make recommendations.
For example, if you buy this video game, then Amazon would suggest other
kinds of items such as customers who buy this item.
Item also bought may be a microphone or other kinds of games.
So this is actually at the core of recommender systems
to use another data and learn from it to make such recommendations.
Your email system is also enhanced with AI capabilities.
There's a spam filter in your email that actually helps
sort your emails as spam or non spam.
And this AI system is actually learning from your own actions,
when you interact with your emails you're teaching this system how to behave and
how to sort your emails.
So it leverages some techniques such as naive Bayes' classifiers.
And other kinds of classifiers to be able to classify your text or
your email text as a spam or non spam.
It could also leverage your existing emails to propose maybe some ads so
your email is also having some intelligence and
is using it to make your experience browsing your emails much better.
Another widely used and outstanding successful application
of artificial intelligence, is face detection.
So you'll all use some kind of smartphone to take pictures of our kids or
our family and friends.
Whenever we do that, we could see that, quickly, we have some.
things being detected here which are rectangles around the faces.
Doesn't go through the shirts or through the background.
There is an accurate and fast way to detect those faces on
the picture that is done by a method called the Viola Johns, named after
its inventors Paul Viola and Michael Johns who wrote the paper about this methodology
in a conference on computer vision and pattern recognition in 2001.
This has been of the most successful applications of AI.
The Viola Jones method detects and classifies images as having a face or
not based on a different features rather than pixels.
Instead of using pixels, the algorithm will use windows of 24x24 pixels.
to recognize whether there are different rectangle features in them.
So for example this is an example of a kind of rectangle feature
that actually can help identify the area of the eyes separated by
the area of the nose which is lighter in the middle.
Another possible feature could be the area of the eyes.
On the top and the area of the cheeks on the bottom.
So, we're going to have a sliding window of 24 by 24 pixels going through the image
and try to see whether these these features are exhibited this kind of,
what we call rectangle features are exhibited in this area in order
to be able to classify the images.
So the algorithm uses also AdaBoost, which is a machine learning algorithm that helps
to do classification in a boosting which we'll see in the next lectures.
Besides this presentation,
the algorithm also uses boosting algorithms and specifically the Ada boost
machine algorithm that allows to focus on the area of interest.
In which there is likely a face rather than the background, for example,
of the image.
It has been very successful to do that.
This method is very successful.
it fails sometimes when we have some problem with luminosity or orientation.
For example, this person here has a hat which covers most of the eyes and
part of the nose.
So the feature patterns that actually tries to identify
different rectangles in the face fail.
And same thing for this person here that has his head little bit on the right side.
So but in general it's doing a great job, it is accurate and
fast and it's embarked in many face detection systems.
Another area in which AI is making also a good progress is face recognition.
It's not a completely solved problem yet, but it is a very good progress being made.
In face recognition we try to identify people on a face on
only whether they exist or not, detected or not.
But we want to be able to identify who is who.
But this is actually prone to error because
there would be different illumination, different pose.
The person could be smiling or not.
Could be in the morning or in the afternoon, wearing glasses or not.
Turning left or right.
So there are so many variations that make face recognition challenging but
as I said, good progress as they made in this area.
Remaining in the vision topic of AI, there has been significant progress
in medical imaging such as detection of breast cancer and mammography images.
And many, many more applications that require.
Imaging of the body, the brain, and the bones.
Adversarial search or games represent an important part of AI.
Because it is challenging and because human has always wanted to create computer
programs or intelligent machines that play against humans.
An example is the chess game.
In 1997 Gary Kasparov, the world champion of chess was
defeated by Deep Blue the IBM machine that was able to use and
leverage powerful search algorithms to win the game against Kasparov.
Another example is Jeopardy!
in 2011 in which a human plays against IBM Watson in Jeopardy!
And IBM Watson was the winner of the game and leveraged natural language
understanding and information extraction to answer the questions.
This is the first time where the machine that only used search algorithms and
used its computational powers against human.
It also used some natural language understanding of the questions and
digging into the resources online to get information and answer the questions.
And last remarkable event this year regarding AI and games is when Lee Sedol,
the world champion in "Go" which is in an ancient game,
was defeated by Google AlphaGo.
In the match in which Google AlphaGo won 4-1.
It leverages deep learning, reinforcement learning, and
search algorithms to complete the search for the best moves, assuming that
here we have actually a complicated search problem because the branching factors, or
the number of possible moves exceeds 300.
So it's a complicated search problem for AI.
And yet AlphaGo leveraging a combination of these techniques,
was able to defeat the world champion in this area.
Last but not least in the series of AI applications, is autonomous driving or
self driving cars.
So it has been a dream for a long time.
But the dream is starting to become true.
It's personally my dream to get into a car, not worry about the commute time and
driving.
And just relax, have a cup of tea and read.
So the area is flourishing.
thanks to the advances in technology, in sensors, etc.
And it's also flourishing thanks to different challenges that were
done by DARPA.
It was the DARPA Grand Challenge in which a self driving cars has to drive
132 miles in 2005.
The winner was Stanford.
2007 it launched also the urban challenge which was even more challenging for
cars and it ended up with winners from CMU and
finally Google car is also becoming a reality in 2009.
Where Google started Getting interested in self-driving cars and designing those.
So the dream is not far really,
I don't know how many decades we need to wait because there is a big change and
shift in our mindset and our thinking about how we interact with cars.
There is a lot of logistics and policy that needs to be looked at in order to
make this really happen, and switching to the self driving cars era.
I just went through a large number of AI applications.
They're actually, AI is all over the place, they're also other application that
actually I didn't talk about such as fraud detection web search engine,
social network analysis, route finding, protein design, document summarization,
transportation scheduling, information extraction, and so on and so forth.
And there are many, many other applications that could actually leverage
AI capabilities to make our life better.
Information extraction in search engine leverage just the billions of webpages out
there, and can bring those in a blink of an eye the set of a ranked list of
possible interesting result for
the query that actually users are going up such as rank, rank and
algorithm, Google rank and it's variants to get this kind of information.
So it is another kind of application of AI that we all use pretty much on a daily
basis.
