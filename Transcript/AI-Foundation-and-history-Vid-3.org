This was for the state of the art of AI.
How about the foundation of AI?
AI is an interdisciplinary field and
several other disciplines have contributed to its progress and this includes
mathematics, economics, linguistics, neuroscience, control theory and
cybernetics, psychology, computer engineering, and finally philosophy.
Given how broad the field is, it won't be possible to go every single contribution.
However, let's go through the main concept introduced by each of these disciplines.
With no surprise philosophers were the first AI contributors.
They formulated ideas for AI, starting with Aristotle in 400 BC.
They considered the mind as a machine,
our physical system operating as a set of logical rules.
There have been different philosophy movements including rationalism,
dualism, materialism, empiricism, induction, etc.
But differently philosophy was the provided the foundation of learning
language rationality in AI.
So how about mathematics?
Mathematicians provided the tools to formalize and manipulate logic.
They also worked out the details of propositional logic and first order logic.
Mathematics also lead the ground for algorithms for
logical deduction to draw valid conclusions.
The first algorithm is believed to be the Euclid algorithms
to calculate the greatest common divisor GCD.
Finally mathematicians also contributed with the theory of probability
invaluable to help deal with uncertainty in the real world.
Economists provided the formal theory of rational decisions to maximize
what they call payoff or utility.
They combine decision theory and probability theory for decision making and
uncertainly.
They also address game theory in which an agent is planning to maximize its
utility in the presence of an opponent who is aiming or planning against him.
Economists also formalize mark of decision processes as a class of sequential
decision problems with the mark of property.
Neuroscience contributed to AI progress by addressing how brain functions and
how brains and computers are similar or dissimilar.
A good progress has been made so far in understanding how the brain functions.
And we could expect more involvement in AI in the next decades or so.
Psychologists care about how we think and act.
Cognitive psychology specifically perceives the brain as an information
processing machine.
It lead to the development of the field of cognitive science.
How could computer models and
used to study language, memory and thinking from a psychological perspective.
Another important disciplines contributing to AI is computer engineering,
that cares about how to build powerful machines to make AI possible.
For example although the idea of self driving cars or
autonomous driving has been there for decades,
it's became only possible today thanks to advances in computer engineering.
Control theory and cybernetics aim to design simple optimal agents receiving
feedback from the environment.
Today modern control theory design systems that maximize
an objective functions over time.
Which gets AI and control theory today closer disciplines than ever.
Following linguistics care about how our languages and thinking related.
And today modern linguistics and AI,
format we call computational linguistics or natural language processing which is
a very important piece in natural language understanding in artificial intelligence.
The list of AI founders is huge.
This list is not meant to be exhaustive in any way.
I just provided some famous names who contributed to AI but
the list is very long and it's actually longer today with more contributors coming
from statistics, from computer science and all the fields that we just mentioned.
How about AI resources?
There are tons and tons of AI resources that cover both the history of AI and
also the technical side, the algorithms and methods of AI.
You could also tap and read articles from the major journals and conferences, and
this included the general of artificial intelligence, TPMI, JMLR, IJCAI,
AAAI, etc., that actually have very state of the art methodologies and
progress could be found there.
If rather prefer to watch videos, there is a large sections of video lectures on
videolectures.net in which you have different subtopics of artificial
intelligence and also artificial intelligence itself that you could watch.
So how about AI history?
AI is a broad field with a long history, it went through ups and downs, successes
and failures, optimism and disappointment, big enthusiasm with with large funding.
And then cutting funding and so on and so forth.
It is now maturing.
But you could summarize the history of AI along these big lines.
The gestation of AI occurred in the 40s and 50s and up to the with the Boolean
circuit to model the brain from McCulloch and Pitts.
Another big event that's happened during this time is Turing's Computing Machinery
and Intelligence article that you could actually check in these archives and
this link here in which Alan Turing has laid down
the principles of artificial intelligence and
designed his Turing test or imitation game to test machine for intelligence.
The years between the 50s and 70s have witnessed early enthusiasm and
great expectation for AI.
Starting with early AI program in chess and
also in checkers such as Samuelâ€™s checkers program.
A big event also happened which is the birth of AI altogether
in a meeting called the Dartmouth meeting
in 1956 in which Paul McCarthy actually coined the term artificial intelligence.
I invite you to check out the MIT video, the thinking machine on YouTube
in which you would see several researchers being interviewed about AI.
And you could see their early enthusiasm and
great expectation about what AI can do in the next few years.
The years 70s and 90s have known the development of knowledge based
systems where only expert systems have no industrial booms and
then they collapsed, dealing to the AI winter.
Finally the availability of very logical sets is another important aspect of AI
today,as data will drive future discoveries and
alleviate the complexity of artificial intelligence.
Agents are everywhere and data is everywhere which will
speed up discoveries and research, and progress in AI for Science and Society.
