** Week 1 HW Assignment

*** 1. What definition of Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned in today's lecture:
    [] The ability to learn and solve problems
    [] The intelligence exhibited by machines or software
    [] The branch of Computer Science dealing with the creation of autonomous systems better at solving hard problems than humans.

*** 10. In "The Imitation Game" paper, Alan Turing admitted the diffculties of answering the question "Can machines think," and he proposed an alternate question. Which question from the following did he suggest?
    [] Can computers solve computational problems efficiently?
    [] Can agents behave rationally?
    [] Is artificial intellgience feasible?
    [] Is Turing Machine the best AI?
    [] Can a machine behave intelligently so that a human interrogator can not tell whether it is a human or a machine?
